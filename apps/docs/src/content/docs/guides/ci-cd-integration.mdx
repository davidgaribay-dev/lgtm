## Overview

LGTM integrates into CI/CD pipelines through two tools:

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| **Playwright Reporter** | Automatically uploads test results from Playwright runs |
| **CLI** | Query test data, create runs, submit results from any test framework |

## GitHub Actions example

### Playwright tests with LGTM reporter

```yaml
name: E2E Tests
on:
  push:
    branches: [main]
  pull_request:

jobs:
  e2e:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: 20
          cache: "npm"

      - run: npm ci
      - run: npx playwright install --with-deps

      - name: Run Playwright tests
        run: npx playwright test
        env:
          LGTM_API_URL: ${{ secrets.LGTM_API_URL }}
          LGTM_API_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.LGTM_API_TOKEN }}
          LGTM_PROJECT_KEY: ENG

      - uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
        if: failure()
        with:
          name: playwright-report
          path: playwright-report/
```

### CLI-based workflow

For non-Playwright test frameworks, use the CLI:

```yaml
name: Tests
on: [push]

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    env:
      LGTM_API_URL: ${{ secrets.LGTM_API_URL }}
      LGTM_API_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.LGTM_API_TOKEN }}
      LGTM_PROJECT_KEY: ENG

    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: 20

      - run: npm ci
      - run: npm install -g @lgtm/cli

      # Create a test run
      - name: Create test run
        id: create-run
        run: |
          RESULT=$(lgtm test-runs create -p ENG -n "CI #$GITHUB_RUN_NUMBER" \
            --cases ENG-1,ENG-2,ENG-3 --json)
          echo "run_id=$(echo $RESULT | jq -r '.id')" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT

      # Run your tests and submit results
      - name: Run tests and submit
        run: |
          npm test
          lgtm test-results bulk --run ${{ steps.create-run.outputs.run_id }} \
            -f test-results.json
```

## Required secrets

| Secret | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `LGTM_API_URL` | Your LGTM instance URL |
| `LGTM_API_TOKEN` | API token with appropriate permissions |

## Best practices

1. **Use project-scoped tokens** — Create a token scoped to the specific project your CI pipeline targets.
2. **Set descriptive run names** — Include the CI run number and branch name for traceability.
3. **Enable auto-create defects** — Automatically file bugs for new failures in CI.
4. **Upload artifacts** — Enable `uploadAttachments` to capture screenshots and traces for failed tests.
5. **Use `LGTM_DEBUG=true`** when troubleshooting reporter issues.
