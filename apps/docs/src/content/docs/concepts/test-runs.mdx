description: Execute test cases and track results
---

A **test run** is an execution instance — a collection of test cases to be run together, with results recorded per case.

## Properties

| Property | Type | Description |
|----------|------|-------------|
| **Name** | string | Descriptive name (e.g., "Sprint 5 Regression") |
| **Status** | enum | `pending`, `in_progress`, `passed`, `failed`, `blocked` |
| **Run Key** | string | Auto-generated `{TEAM_KEY}-TR-{number}` (e.g., `ENG-TR-5`) |
| **Environment** | FK | Optional link to an [environment](/concepts/environments/) |
| **Cycle** | FK | Optional link to a team [cycle](/concepts/cycles/) |
| **Workspace Cycle** | FK | Optional link to a workspace cycle |
| **Test Plan** | FK | Optional link to a [test plan](#test-plans) used to populate the run |

## Status transitions

```
pending → in_progress → passed / failed / blocked
```

- **pending** — Run created but not started
- **in_progress** — Execution underway
- **passed** — All cases passed (auto-computed from results)
- **failed** — At least one case failed
- **blocked** — At least one case blocked, none failed

## Test plans

A **test plan** is a saved selection of test cases that can be loaded when creating a run. Plans have their own status lifecycle:

| Status | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `draft` | Being prepared |
| `active` | Ready for use |
| `completed` | Finished |
| `archived` | No longer active |
