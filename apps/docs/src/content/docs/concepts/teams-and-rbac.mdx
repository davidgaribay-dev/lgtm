## Organizations

An **organization** (workspace) is the top-level container. Each organization has:
- A display name and URL slug
- Members with organization-level roles
- One or more teams
- Workspace cycles for cross-team tracking
- API tokens for programmatic access

## Teams

**Teams** (called "projects" internally) are the primary unit of organization. Each team has:
- A display name and immutable **key** (2-10 uppercase letters, e.g., `ENG`)
- Its own test cases, runs, defects, environments, cycles, and shared steps
- Team-level members with team-specific roles
- Team-scoped API tokens

### Team keys

Keys follow the pattern `^[A-Z]{2,10}$`. They are:
- Unique per organization
- Immutable after creation
- Used in human-readable identifiers (`ENG-42`, `ENG-TR-5`, `ENG-D-12`)
- Auto-generated from team name (e.g., "Engineering Team" → `ENG`)

Reserved keys: `TEST`, `TEMP`, `ADMIN`, `ROOT`, `API`, `APP`, `WEB`, `DASHBOARD`, `TEAMS`, `SETTINGS`

## Organization roles

| Role | Capabilities |
|------|-------------|
| **Owner** | Full control, including deleting the organization |
| **Admin** | All actions except organization deletion |
| **Member** | Create/edit test cases, execute runs |
| **Viewer** | Read-only access |

## Team roles

| Role | Capabilities |
|------|-------------|
| **Team Owner** | Full team control (settings, members, delete) |
| **Team Admin** | Manage content, environments, members (cannot delete team) |
| **Team Member** | Create/edit test cases, execute runs |
| **Team Viewer** | Read-only access to team resources |

## Permission resolution

1. **Org admins/owners** automatically get team admin access to all teams (no explicit membership required)
2. **Explicit team membership** grants team-specific roles
3. **No org admin role + No team membership** = No access to the team

## Invitations

- Organization invitations include a role assignment
- Team invitations include a team role assignment
- Invitations expire after 7 days
- Emails sent via Resend (falls back to console.log if not configured)
