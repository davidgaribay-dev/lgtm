title: Test Results
description: Per-case verdicts within a test run
---

A **test result** records the outcome of a single test case within a test run.

## Properties

| Property | Type | Description |
|----------|------|-------------|
| **Status** | enum | `untested`, `passed`, `failed`, `blocked`, `skipped` |
| **Comment** | string | Optional notes about the result |
| **Duration** | integer | Execution time in milliseconds |
| **Executed By** | FK | User who recorded the result |
| **Executed At** | timestamp | When the result was recorded |

## Test step results

Each test result can have per-step results tracking the outcome of individual steps within the test case:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Status** | Same enum as test result status |
| **Actual Result** | What actually happened (for failed steps) |
| **Comment** | Optional notes |

## Bulk submission

Results are submitted in bulk via `POST /api/test-runs/{id}/results`. Each entry includes:

```json
{
  "results": [
    {
      "testCaseId": "uuid-1",
      "status": "passed",
      "duration": 1200,
      "comment": "All steps verified"
    },
    {
      "testCaseId": "uuid-2",
      "status": "failed",
      "comment": "Login button not visible"
    }
  ]
}
```

The API creates or updates results based on the `testCaseId` within the run.
