## Additional fields

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Steps to Reproduce** | How to trigger the bug |
| **Expected Result** | What should happen |
| **Actual Result** | What actually happens |
| **External URL** | Link to external issue tracker |
| **Assignee** | User responsible for fixing |

## Traceability

Defects can be linked to:
- **Test Case** — The case that revealed the defect
- **Test Run** — The run where it was found
- **Test Result** — The specific result that failed
- **Environment** — Where the defect was observed
- **Cycle** — Sprint/release context

## Status workflow

```
open → in_progress → fixed → verified → closed
  ↑                    ↓
  └── reopened ←───────┘

open → deferred / rejected / duplicate
```
