LGTM organizes test management around a hierarchy of entities. Understanding how they relate helps you use the platform effectively.

## Entity hierarchy

```
Organization (Workspace)
├── Teams (Projects)
│   ├── Test Suites
│   │   ├── Sections (nested folders)
│   │   └── Test Cases
│   │       └── Test Steps
│   ├── Shared Steps (reusable step sequences)
│   │   └── Shared Step Actions
│   ├── Test Plans (curated case selections)
│   ├── Test Runs
│   │   ├── Test Results (one per case per run)
│   │   │   └── Test Step Results
│   │   └── Logs (run-level and result-level)
│   ├── Defects
│   ├── Environments
│   ├── Cycles (team-level sprints)
│   └── API Tokens (team-scoped)
├── Workspace Cycles (cross-team releases)
├── Members (org-level roles)
└── API Tokens (workspace-scoped)
```

## Key concepts

### Organizations and teams

An **organization** (workspace) is the top-level container. Within it, you create **teams** (called "projects" in the database). Each team has its own test cases, runs, defects, and settings.

Teams use short **keys** (2-10 uppercase letters like `ENG`, `QA`, `BACKEND`) that form part of human-readable identifiers.

### Human-readable identifiers

Every major entity gets a human-readable key:

| Entity | Pattern | Example |
|--------|---------|---------|
| Test Case | `{TEAM_KEY}-{number}` | `ENG-42` |
| Test Run | `{TEAM_KEY}-TR-{number}` | `ENG-TR-5` |
| Defect | `{TEAM_KEY}-D-{number}` | `ENG-D-12` |

Numbers auto-increment per team. These keys are used in URLs, the CLI, and the Playwright reporter for matching.

### IDs

All entities use UUID primary keys internally. The human-readable keys are used in URLs and external references. API routes accept UUIDs for entity operations (e.g., `PATCH /api/test-cases/{id}`), while lookup-by-key endpoints exist for human-friendly access (e.g., `GET /api/test-cases/by-key?caseKey=ENG-42`).

### Soft delete

All application entities support soft deletion via `deleted_at` / `deleted_by` columns. Deleted entities are excluded from all queries but remain in the database for audit purposes.

### Audit fields

Every entity tracks creation and modification metadata:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `created_at` | Timestamp of creation |
| `created_by` | User ID of creator |
| `updated_at` | Timestamp of last update |
| `updated_by` | User ID of last updater |
| `deleted_at` | Timestamp of soft deletion |
| `deleted_by` | User ID of deleter |
