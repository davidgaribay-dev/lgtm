title: Cycles
description: Sprint and release tracking for test execution
---

**Cycles** represent time-boxed periods (sprints, releases) for organizing test execution.

## Dual-level cycles

LGTM supports cycles at two levels:

| Level | Scope | Use case |
|-------|-------|----------|
| **Team cycles** | Per-project | Sprint-level tracking |
| **Workspace cycles** | Organization-wide | Release-level tracking |

## Properties

| Property | Type | Values |
|----------|------|--------|
| **Name** | string | Required, unique per scope |
| **Status** | enum | `planned`, `active`, `completed` |
| **Start Date** | date | Optional |
| **End Date** | date | Optional |
| **Is Current** | boolean | Whether this is the active cycle |

## Dual foreign keys

Test entities have **two cycle foreign keys** for flexible tracking:

- `cycle_id` — Team-level cycle
- `workspace_cycle_id` — Organization-level cycle

This applies to test cases, test runs, and test results, allowing entities to be tracked at both sprint and release levels simultaneously.
