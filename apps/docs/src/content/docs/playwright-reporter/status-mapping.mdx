description: How Playwright statuses map to LGTM statuses

## Test result status mapping

| Playwright Status | LGTM Status |
|-------------------|-------------|
| `passed` | `passed` |
| `failed` | `failed` |
| `timedOut` | `failed` |
| `skipped` | `skipped` |
| `interrupted` | `blocked` |

## Run status mapping

The overall run status is determined by the Playwright suite result:

| Playwright Result | LGTM Run Status |
|-------------------|-----------------|
| `passed` | `passed` |
| `failed` | `failed` |
| `timedout` | `failed` |
| `interrupted` | `blocked` |

## Notes

- **Timed out** tests are treated as failures in LGTM since they did not produce a passing result.
- **Interrupted** tests (e.g., from Ctrl+C or CI timeout) are marked as `blocked` since they could not complete.
- **Skipped** tests retain their skip status — they are not treated as failures.
- The run status is set after all results are submitted, so it reflects the final aggregate state.
